# course-materials
lecture slides, notes, quizzes, exams, code from some courses I've taught

General notes: 

Any mistakes are my own.

I have only posted one version of each item (usually there are multiple versions of each quiz and exam, and all materials necessarily evolve).

Quizzes are short in-class exercise sets. They typically have 3-5 questions on them, and, depending on the quiz, were given 20-45 minutes for completion, depending on the computational complexity.

Exams are given for an entire class period, typically 75-100 minutes.

For lecture slides, occasionally information seems "missing" - this was intentionally part of the boardwork technique. Perhaps in the future I'll create videos with voiceover and written annotations on the slides... perhaps.

All materials have been greatly generalized to remove all displayed course-specific information (rooms, times, grading procedures, etc.). What remains is suitable for self-study.

Amidst all the other available materials online, I hope these help a few of you students looking for more practice problems, or some professors that want some prepared materials their students haven't seen yet.
